This project will focus on modeling the spread of an infectious disease using methods learned throughout the semester using an SIR model (susceptible-infected-recovered)
This model uses differential equations to demonstrate how the population transitions between these three stages. This project will demonstrate how we can use methods learned in MAE384 to model real life scenarios and help to save lives. 
The 4 parts of this project include using 1. Numerical solutions to  ODE systems (4th order Runge-Kutta) 2. Interpolation 3. Least Squares regression 4. Fourier Analysis

All MatLab codes should be added to this GitHUb as commits. Each group member is tasked with completing one part of the 4 part project
Part 1: Nico Caraceller 
Part 2: Cesar Sanchez
Part 3: Kenny McGregor
Part 4: Wilfred Mueller
